Networks can be categorized by their size.

### LAN

Stands for "local area network." It typically covers a small area, such as a home or office, and connects nearby devices. When devices communicate through a router within this limited area, they are using a LAN.

### WAN

Stands for "wide area network." A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, and the Internet is essentially a global network of interconnected WANs, LANs, and other types of networks.

The number of WANs in the world is not strictly equal to the number of ISPs, but there is a strong correlation. Each ISP typically operates its own WAN to provide connectivity to its customers. However, some organizations, governments, and large enterprises also operate their own private WANs, which are not tied to ISPs.

While the exact number is difficult to determine, the total number of WANs worldwide is in the thousands, combining both ISP-operated and private networks.
