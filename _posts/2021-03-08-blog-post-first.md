### This is a header

#### Some SQL Code

SELECT "This", "Is", "A", "Code", "Block", reverse('abc')
FROM public.SomeTable s
CROSS JOIN public.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {

}
```
